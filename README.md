# ScriptSurfer

ScriptSurfer is a universal application designed to manage and execute scripts across multiple directories both locally and via a web interface. Built with Rust and utilizing `egui` for the GUI, ScriptSurfer aims to provide a seamless experience for managing scripts with function over form.

## Features

- **CLI and GUI:** Support for both command-line interaction and a graphical user interface using `egui`.
- **Web Interface:** A web version of the GUI hosted on a personal website, accessible behind authentication for universal access.
- **Script Management:** Browse, execute, and manage scripts across different folders from a single interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Rust:** For core application logic and system interaction.
- **Egui:** For building the GUI, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for the web interface.
- **WebAssembly (WASM):** To enable running Rust code in the web browser.
- **Wasm-bindgen:** For interacting between WASM and JavaScript.
